## About this template<a id="about"></a>

This template gives you a starting point for your website. It has some sample pages and sets out a well-defined file structure.

## Installing Live Server in Visual Studio Code<a id="live-server"></a>

Live Server lets you see your webpage as you build it. We'll set it up first because it makes it **much easier** to see the effects of our changes as we make them.

### Step 1: Install the Extension

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Click on the **Extensions** sidebar icon.
3. Type `Live Server` in the search bar and find the extension by **Ritwick Dey**.
4. Click **Install**.

### Step 2: Using Live Server

To preview your website:

1. Select the HTML file you want to preview.
2. Click **Go Live** in the status bar at the bottom right of VSCode.
3. Your default web browser will open automatically, showing your page.
4. Leave the browser tab open. It will update your page as you edit your HTML and CSS.

## Using this template<a id="usage"></a>

### Start by modifying `index.html`

- `index.html` is the default webpage - **don't change the filename**.
- **Page Title**: Update the `<title>` tag within the `head` section with a short name that shows the content or purpose of your page.
- **Header**: Go to the `<header>` and give your website a name. This might be similar to the `<title>`.
- **Body**: Add some content and structure to the `<main>` block of your website. This might just be placeholders to start with.
- **Footer**: Change the footer to include a made-up name for your website business.

### Rename the sample pages

- **Rename samples**: `page2.html` and `page3.html` are sample pages. You should **rename these** - give them short, meaningful names. e.g. _learn-more.html_, _about.html_
- **Update nav in index**: Update the `<a>` links in `<nav>` in `index.html` to use the new filenames.
